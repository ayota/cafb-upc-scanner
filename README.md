#Capital Area Food Bank UPC Scanner Project

#Problem:
CAFB uses information on nutritional information to designate certain donated canned and boxed foods as "wellness" foods. Clients that take have more "wellness foods" as a share of their total purchases are given items they can use like fridges. 
 
#Goal:
All foods that CAFB takes in have UPC codes -- use this code to query a UPC database with nutritional information and return a binary "wellness" or "not wellness" food designation. CAFB's criteria for "wellness foods" are located here. More here: <a href="https://cafb.hackpad.com/Background-rNR5eDuXE2a"> background info </a>.
